//! EEBUS use cases.
//!
//! A use case is the application layer of EEBUS: it names the *actors* involved, the
//! *scenarios* they run, and the SPINE features and functions each scenario needs. Four
//! of them — Limitation of Power Consumption and Production, and Monitoring of Power
//! Consumption and of the Grid Connection Point — have been certifiable since July 2026
//! and are what German §14a EnWG installations are built on.
